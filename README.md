A Restaurant website Project. Made with ♥ by the `Lavish Bansal`. There will be 4 pages in the website (HomePage, MenuPage, ContactPage, BookingPage). In this project we use HTML, CSS and few lines of JS for front-end and Node JS for back-end with MONGO DB database. Later on, in this project, we gonna learn how we can deploy this site using `Render`.
